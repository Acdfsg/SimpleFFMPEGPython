# SimpleFFMPEGPython
This basic script is intended to allow you to convert multiple media files of a specified type in a specified folder to another format. I tried to keep it extremely simple; this is basically a bash script in Python because I couldn't get the various bash scripts out there to work. Use at your own risk and all that.

Requires you have a copy of the ffmpeg executable. I tried the ffmpeg python library and couldn't get it to work. I got my copy from: https://ffmpeg.org/
